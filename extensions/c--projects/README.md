# C# Projects

Search and open C# solution files (.sln and .slnx) in your preferred IDE.

## Features

- **Smart Search**: Automatically finds all .sln and .slnx files in your projects directory
- **Quick Open**: Open solutions directly in Rider, Visual Studio Code, or your default application
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Skips build folders (bin, obj), packages, and hidden directories
- **Stop on Find**: Stops searching subdirectories once a solution is found in a parent folder

## Setup

1. Open the extension in Raycast
2. When prompted, select the folder path where your C# projects are located
3. The extension will recursively search for all solution files

## Usage

- **Enter**: Open in Rider (default)
- **Cmd+V**: Open in Visual Studio Code
- **Cmd+O**: Open with... (choose application)
- **Cmd+F**: Show in Finder/Explorer
- **Cmd+C**: Copy file path

## Configuration

Set your projects search path in the extension preferences (shown on first run).
